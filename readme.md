## Introduction

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for database operations. It is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use, making it one of the most widely used databases in the world. Developed by MySQL AB and now owned by Oracle Corporation, MySQL supports multi-user access and can handle large-scale applications, making it a popular choice for web development, data warehousing, and various enterprise-level applications. MySQL is used to store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently, supporting features like transactions, indexing, and replication. It's a crucial component of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl), commonly used in web development.
